In this project, three contributions will be made. Given this will be the first gamified audit and feedback system, we will be able to report on the collaborative design process and describe a process which can then be replicated elsewhere.

Second, this project will provide estimates of the effect of gamification on adoption and engagement, providing the literature with an alternative strategy to what has often been expensive reward schemes without clear benefits. Alternatively, current evidence on the effect of gamification is often provided for the lay public, this research will generate evidence about the effect of gamification on a set of highly educated professionals.

Finally, this research will provide quantitative estimates of the effect modification of gamification on the performance of the e-A\&F system. Along with it, we will provide qualitative data on the participantsâ€™ perception of the gamified system and on its impact on their motivation and intentions.
