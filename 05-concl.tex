Past research on gamification showed that it works to create engagement, increase time spent, and change behaviour. Looking at the theory underpinning A\&F, it shows overlap with how gamification works and suggests it could work well. Studying gamified systems presents challenges but could lay the ground for further research to elucidate which elements or mechanism are most important for A\&F.
