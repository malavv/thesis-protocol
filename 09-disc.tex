% Study Limitations and Mitigation
A challenge in implementing \gls{EAF} is to build a team of clinical partners who supports the project and helps in planning to prevent rejection, lack of trust, or perceived intrusion. For this reason, I aim to create a local governance team with potential support from the MUHC's clinical pertinence committee. Physicians won't be remunerated for their participation, but a request will be made for them to receive continuing medical education (CME) credits for their participation.

Studying gamification is complicated by the holistic nature of the changes it requires along with the absence of an agreed upon standard. For this reason, all the necessary modifications will be evaluated as-a-whole and I will follow an explicit framework while reporting our design choices and the associated outcomes. Creating a valid synthetic comparator would be difficult given the required differences in design for this reason we used an existing system. Some evidence points to gamified interventions being more fun and future implementations could emphasise this aspect but, here, both arms will receive the same amount and kind of recruitment efforts. A qualitative exploration could be performed after the trial to remedy the RCT design's limitation, collecting richer narrative data on the perception users have of the intervention. It is difficult to identify a threshold of clinical meaningfulness for adoption and engagement as it is difficult to predict their association with health-related patient outcomes.

Also, ongoing quality improvement efforts could threaten the generalizability of the estimated effect of the behavioural intervention. However, because of randomization it is unlikely to affect internal validity. Support staff will be on hand for both systems, and only severe bugs will be fixed during the trial. Secular trends will be difficult to explore but there should be some variation in participants entry time. Contamination is likely to be present with users viewing or sharing reports from another arm. However, since reports are individualized, and the main metrics are adoption and engagement, the effect of contamination is likely to be minimal.
