My research goal is to study the effect of gamification, a behavioural intervention, on electronic audit and feedback (\gls{EAF}).  My hypothesis is that gamification will increase the adoption, retention, and engagement with \gls{EAF}, in comparison to a traditionally designed system. This hypothesis addresses important gaps in evidence regarding the application of gamification and related behavioral theories to \gls{EAF}. I propose a manuscript-based thesis with three objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a set of quality indicators for \gls{EAF} to assess and improve the appropriateness of heart failure management at the MUHC.
    \item Assess the usability and usefulness of gamified \gls{EAF} for physicians at the MUHC.
    \item Estimate the effect of gamification on the adoption, engagement, and effectiveness of e-A\&F at the MUHC.
\end{enumerate}

% "Generally accepted way", will I measure this?
%   - Yes and no.
%     > yes, in the sense that more acceptance means more adoption and engagement
%     > yes-ish, in the sense that this will be touched on in usability metrics
%     > no, in the sense a proper assessment of it would require a qualitative analysis.

% 1 - Are you sure you want to talk about "effect" instead of "association"
%   - There are some limitation to my study, but I'm still doing an RCT. If this is one of the
%     best design to infer causality based on the counterfactual model.
% 2 - Footnote about what traditional system is? It's juste what is done currently
