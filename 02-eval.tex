The goal of this research is to study the impact that gamification, a behavioural intervention, has on electronic audit and feedback. My hypothesis is that gamification will be an effective and generally accepted way of increasing the adoption, retention, and engagement with \gls{EAF} when compared with a traditionally designed systems. This is supported by evidence from the field of gamification and by the overlap in the between gamification and effective theories of behaviour change. I will explore this goal in a manuscript based thesis focused on 3 objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a set of quality indicators for \gls{EAF} to assess and improve the appropriateness of heart failure management in adult patients at the MUHC.
    \item Assess the usability, usefulness, and technical barriers to a gamified \gls{EAF} intervention for physicians at the MUHC.
    \item Estimate how gamification affects adoption, engagement, and effectiveness of an e-A\&F intervention.
\end{enumerate}
