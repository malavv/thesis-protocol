This proposed project will be conducted over 24 months and will include three studies: (1) a descriptive analysis of retrospective data, (2) a laboratory based usability study, and (3) a randomized control trial.

 The first objective is needed to design both the control and experimental interventions and ensure they work with local data. Objective 2 will ensure that both interventions are usable and free from major bugs or obvious unintended effects. It will also be used to foresee any deployment issue with the hospital. Finally, objective 3 addresses the overall hypothesis, the effect of gamification on e-A\&F systems.

\section{Sample Size / Precision}
Everyone?  How many is everyone.  Can we do a quick test to see howclose will this be to sufficient?  Difficulty in putting a clinical meaningfulness threshold?

\section{Ethical Considerations?} % Do I even need this?
Performance feedback is confidential, and wonâ€™ t be shared (unless required by law)
* Taking time away from patient treatment/asking for doctor's time outside of work hours?
* Informed consent will be required from all participants, but not from patients.

-- ?
* Saying something medical, possibly opposite?
