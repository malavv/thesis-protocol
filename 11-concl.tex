Past research on gamification showed improvements in engagement, time spent on site, and lead to change in behaviour. Looking at the theory underpinning A\&F, it shows overlap with how gamification works and suggests it could work well. Studying gamified systems presents challenges but could lay the ground for further research to elucidate which elements or mechanism are most important for future \gls{EAF}. Future research will be supported by the core system code for this project being made open source for non-commercial purposes.
