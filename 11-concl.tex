Past research on gamification has shown that it affects engagement and time spent on site, and that it can change behaviour. The theory underpinning A\&F overlaps with how gamification works and suggests it has a potential role in enhancing the effect of \gls{EAF}. Studying gamified systems presents challenges but could lay the foundation for further research to elucidate which elements or mechanism are most important for \gls{EAF}. Future research will be supported by the core system code of this project being made open source for non-commercial purposes.
